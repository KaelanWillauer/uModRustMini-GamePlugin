# uModRustMini-GamePlugin
Mini-Game system manager developed with the uMod API for Rust. Originally created to manage other pluginsâ€™ games, the manager acts as a simple method to add custom game-modes to Rust.
Although created around patch [234](https://rust.facepunch.com/news/community-update-234), this plugin runs fully functional as of May 1, 2022 on patch [APRIL2022UPDATE](https://rust.facepunch.com/changelist/3921). The map is still supported but may need to be re-exported from [RustEdit](https://www.rustedit.io/). 
# GCLOUD HOSTING
#### [Here](/gcloudrust.pdf) is a quick guide to spinning up a rust server on [GCLOUD](https://cloud.google.com/). Although not quite comprehensive, it provides the steps necessary for hosting game servers.
